# SUBSTRATE DEPLETION AND REPLETION

Energy substrates—molecules that provide starting materials for bioenergetic reactions, including **phosphagens** (ATP and creatine phosphate, ATP和肌酸磷酸), **glucose**, **glycogen** (糖原), **lactate** (乳酸), **free fatty acids** (游离脂肪酸), and **amino acids** (氨基酸)—can be selectively depleted during the performance of activities of various intensities and durations. Subsequently, the amount of energy that can be produced by the bioenergetic systems decreases.

## Phosphagen System (ATP-PCr System, 磷酸源系统)

### 1. **Phosphagen Depletion** (磷酸源消耗)
   - **Fatigue** (疲劳) during physical activity is often linked to the depletion of **phosphagens** (ATP and creatine phosphate) and **glycogen** (糖原).
   - **Phosphagens** are rapidly depleted during **high-intensity anaerobic exercise** (高强度无氧运动).
   - **Creatine phosphate** (肌酸磷酸) can decrease by **50% to 70%** in the first **5 to 30 seconds** of **high-intensity exercise** and may be completely depleted with **exercise to exhaustion** (力竭).
   - **Muscle ATP** (肌肉ATP) levels generally don’t drop more than **60%** even during very intense exercise, despite **creatine phosphate** depletion.
   - **Dynamic muscle actions** (动态肌肉动作), such as **weight training repetitions** (举重重复动作), deplete **phosphagens** more than **isometric actions** (等长动作), such as arm wrestling, which involves no visible muscle shortening.

### 2. **Phosphagen Repletion** (磷酸源补充)
   - After exercise, **phosphagen repletion** occurs relatively quickly:
     - **ATP resynthesis** (ATP再合成) can occur in about **3 to 5 minutes**.
     - **Creatine phosphate resynthesis** (肌酸磷酸再合成) can be completed within **8 minutes**.
   - The repletion process primarily occurs through **aerobic metabolism** (有氧代谢), although **fast glycolysis** (快速糖酵解) can also contribute to ATP resynthesis after high-intensity exercise.
   - **Creatine supplementation** (肌酸补充) can enhance the repletion of the **phosphagen system** (磷酸源系统).

## Glycogen Depletion and Repletion (糖原消耗与补充)

### 1. **Glycogen Storage** (糖原储存)
   - **Glycogen** (糖原) is stored in the muscles and liver:
     - Approximately **300 to 400 g** of glycogen is stored in **muscles** (肌肉).
     - About **70 to 100 g** is stored in the **liver** (肝脏).
   - The amount of glycogen stored can be influenced by training and dietary factors.

### 2. **Glycogen Depletion During Exercise** (运动中的糖原消耗)
   - **Muscle glycogen** (肌肉糖原) is the more important fuel during **moderate- and high-intensity** exercise.
   - **Liver glycogen** (肝糖原) is more important during **low-intensity** exercise and contributes more as the exercise duration increases.
   - During **high-intensity exercise**, **glycogen** becomes the preferred fuel source, and its depletion can become a limiting factor for continued performance.
   - High-intensity activities above **60% to 75% of VO₂max** increase the rate of **muscle glycogenolysis** (肌肉糖原分解), increasing the amount of available glycogen for **glycolysis** (糖酵解).
   - **Resistance training** (抗阻训练) can lead to significant glycogen depletion, ranging from **24% to 40%**, depending on intensity, volume, and muscle fiber types.

### 3. **Glycogen Repletion Post-Exercise** (运动后糖原补充)
   - **Glycogen resynthesis** (糖原再合成) begins immediately after exercise and is most rapid during the first **5 to 6 hours** of recovery.
   - **Carbohydrate ingestion** (碳水化合物摄入) is critical for optimizing glycogen storage.
     - The optimal intake is **1.2 g per kilogram of body weight** every **2 hours** after exercise.
   - Muscle glycogen can be fully replenished within **24 hours** if enough carbohydrates are ingested.
   - If exercise involves high **eccentric** components (偏心成分), such as muscle damage from resistance training, more time may be needed for complete glycogen replenishment.

### **Summary of Key Concepts**

- **Energy substrates** (能量底物) like **phosphagens** (ATP, creatine phosphate), **glycogen**, and **fat** are crucial for energy production.
- **Phosphagen depletion** (磷酸源消耗) is common in high-intensity activities and affects performance, but repletion is rapid with **aerobic metabolism**.
- **Glycogen depletion** (糖原消耗) is more significant during high-intensity exercise, and **muscle glycogen** (肌肉糖原) is the primary source of energy.
- **Glycogen resynthesis** (糖原再合成) can be optimized through **carbohydrate ingestion** (碳水化合物摄入), especially during the **first 5-6 hours** of recovery.
- **Creatine supplementation** (肌酸补充) helps accelerate the recovery of the **phosphagen system** and supports high-intensity exercise performance.
