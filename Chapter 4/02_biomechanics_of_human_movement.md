# BIOMETRICS OF HUMAN MOVEMENT

Biomechanics plays a critical role in understanding how the body moves and how force is produced during movement. This knowledge is essential for developing training programs that optimize performance, reduce injury risk, and increase movement efficiency.

## 1. Muscle

### **Muscle Architecture**

- **Muscle Fiber Arrangement**: The arrangement of muscle fibers relative to the tendon influences the muscleâ€™s ability to produce force and the range of motion (ROM).
  - **Parallel Fibers**: Fibers run parallel to the tendon and are better suited for movements that require a greater range of motion but produce less force (e.g., sartorius).
  - **Pennate Fibers**: Fibers are arranged at an angle to the tendon and generate greater force due to a larger cross-sectional area (e.g., quadriceps).

### **Length-Tension Relationship**

- The relationship between muscle length and the force it can generate. Muscles generate maximal force at their optimal length, where actin and myosin filaments overlap most efficiently.
  - **Resting Length**: At this length, actin and myosin overlap optimally, maximizing force production.
  - **Stretched Muscle**: At longer lengths, the overlap between actin and myosin decreases, reducing force output.
  - **Shortened Muscle**: When a muscle is too short, there is less overlap between the filaments, leading to reduced force production.

### **Force-Velocity Relationship**

- **Concentric Muscle Actions**: During concentric contractions (when the muscle shortens), **faster velocities** are associated with **lower force production**. This is because the muscle doesn't have enough time to generate maximal force when contracting quickly.
  
- **Isometric Muscle Actions**: In isometric contractions (where the muscle generates force but its length remains unchanged), **more force** is produced compared to any concentric contraction. The absence of length change allows the muscle to produce maximum force.

- **Eccentric Muscle Actions**: Muscles are capable of generating **more force eccentrically** (when lengthening under load) than they can concentrically or isometrically. This happens because, during eccentric contractions, the muscle is "resisting" the external load, and the force generated is higher compared to when the muscle is shortening or holding static.

- **Effect of Speed on Eccentric Actions**: Eccentric muscle actions increase in force production as **velocity increases**, meaning that muscles can generate higher forces when they are lengthening faster (e.g., during a fast, controlled lowering phase in a squat or bench press). This is different from concentric muscle actions, where faster speeds lead to reduced force production.

### **Fiber Type and Specific Tension**

- **Type I Fibers (Slow-Twitch)**: These fibers are efficient at using oxygen and are best suited for endurance activities. They generate less force than Type II fibers.
  
- **Type II Fibers (Fast-Twitch)**: These fibers produce more force but fatigue faster, making them more suited for high-intensity, explosive activities like sprinting and weightlifting.

- **Specific Tension**: This refers to the maximum force that a muscle fiber type can produce relative to its cross-sectional area. Type II fibers generally have higher specific tension than Type I fibers.

### **Recruitment**

- **Motor Unit Recruitment**: When a muscle contracts, motor units (a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates) are recruited in a specific order. Smaller motor units (containing Type I fibers) are recruited first, followed by larger motor units (containing Type II fibers) as the force demands increase.
  
- **Size Principle**: Motor units are recruited from smallest to largest, depending on the amount of force required by the movement.

### **Time History of Activation**

- **Muscular Force Development**: Muscular force development is not instantaneous and takes time to reach maximum levels. It can take up to **0.5 seconds** to develop maximal muscle force. If an activity lasts less than 0.5 seconds, maximal muscular force will not be attained. In such cases, **Rate of Force Development (RFD)** is an important factor in determining performance.

- **Rate of Force Development (RFD)**: RFD is defined as the **time rate of change of force**, or the ratio of the change in force over the change in time. It describes how quickly force can be generated by a muscle. RFD should not be confused with **power**. For instance, isometric actions can develop force quickly (with minimal or no muscle length change), but power would be zero in these cases because there is no velocity or muscle length change involved.

- **Improving RFD**: The rate of force development can be improved with **resistance exercise**. Plyometric training, for example, enhances RFD by utilizing the **stretch-shortening cycle (SSC)**. This cycle involves an **eccentric muscle action** (muscle lengthening) immediately followed by a **concentric muscle action** (muscle shortening). The rapid transition between these two phases enhances force production. 

- **Elastic Energy and Neural Drive**: The enhanced force production through the SSC is attributed to the **storage of elastic energy** during the eccentric phase, which is released during the concentric phase. Additionally, **neural drive** is enhanced, facilitating faster muscle activation.

- **Pre-forcing**: In some movements (e.g., **bench press** or **squat**), **pre-forcing** (activating the muscle before the movement begins) can be seen when the muscle is tensed before initiating the lift. This pre-tension makes it easier to overcome inertia at the start of the movement. For example, it is harder to lift the bar from the bottom of the squat or bench press if it is resting on supports. However, if the muscles are pre-forced (tensed before lifting), the movement becomes easier. This is especially noticeable when the muscle is **pre-forced** and the bar is reversed quickly at the bottom position, benefiting from the elastic recoil of the muscle-tendon complex and the pre-forcing effect.

## 2. Moment Arms and Levers of the Human Body

- **Moment Arm**: The moment arm is the perpendicular distance between the line of action of a force and the axis of rotation (joint). The longer the moment arm, the greater the torque produced by a given force.
  
- **Levers**: The body uses bones and joints as levers to create movement.
  - **First-Class Lever**: The fulcrum is located between the force and the load (e.g., neck extension).
  - **Second-Class Lever**: The load is between the fulcrum and the effort (e.g., calf raise).
  - **Third-Class Lever**: The effort is between the fulcrum and the load (e.g., biceps curl).

- **Mechanical Advantage**: Most levers in the human body are third-class, meaning they do not provide a mechanical advantage in terms of force but offer advantages in terms of speed and range of motion.

## 3. Strength and Sticking Points

- **Sticking Point**: The sticking point is the part of a movement where it is most difficult to overcome resistance, usually occurring when the joint changes its angle, making the lever arm less favorable.
  - Common sticking points are found near the transition between eccentric and concentric movements (e.g., near the midpoint of a squat or bench press).

- **Force Production at Sticking Points**: The mechanical advantage at the sticking point is reduced, which often requires more force to continue the movement. Training around sticking points (e.g., through **eccentric training**, **isometric holds**, or **dynamic effort** techniques) can help improve performance and strength at these critical moments.

## 4. Kinematic and Kinetic Chains

### **Kinematic Chain**

- A kinematic chain is a system of joints and their associated muscles that work together to produce movement.
  - **Open Kinetic Chain (OKC)**: Movements where the distal end of a limb is free to move (e.g., leg extensions, bicep curls). These movements tend to target single joints.
  
  - **Closed Kinetic Chain (CKC)**: Movements where the distal end of a limb is fixed (e.g., squats, push-ups). These exercises involve multiple joints and are often more functional, mimicking real-life movements.

### **Kinetic Chain**

- The kinetic chain focuses on the forces acting on the body during movement and how they affect performance.
  - **Internal Forces**: Forces generated by muscles and tendons.
  - **External Forces**: Forces applied from the environment, such as gravity or external weights.

- **Proximal to Distal Transfer of Force**: Many movements (e.g., throwing, sprinting) involve the transfer of force from the core (proximal) to the limbs (distal). Proper coordination between these segments is essential for efficient movement and performance.
