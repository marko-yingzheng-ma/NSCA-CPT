# Structure and Function of Skeletal Muscle

- **Structure**: 
  - Skeletal muscles consist of muscle fibers (cells) wrapped in connective tissue layers:
    - **Epimysium**: Surrounds the entire muscle.
    - **Perimysium**: Surrounds fascicles (bundles of muscle fibers).
    - **Endomysium**: Surrounds individual muscle fibers.
  - Muscle fibers are made up of myofibrils, which are sectioned by sarcomeres, containing the contractile proteins:
    - **Actin** (thin filament)
    - **Myosin** (thick filament)

- **Function**: 
  - Skeletal muscles are responsible for voluntary movements. When stimulated by the nervous system, actin and myosin interact to produce contraction, generating force and movement at joints.

# Sliding Filament Theory of Muscle Action

1. **Step 1**: Action potential travels along the motor neuron and reaches the muscle fiber, causing the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
2. **Step 2**: Calcium binds to **troponin**, shifting **tropomyosin** and exposing myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments.
3. **Step 3**: Myosin heads bind to actin, forming cross-bridges.
4. **Step 4**: The myosin heads perform a power stroke, pulling actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere, shortening the muscle.
5. **Step 5**: ATP binds to myosin, causing detachment from actin.
6. **Step 6**: ATP is hydrolyzed, re-energizing myosin heads for the next cycle. The process repeats until the action potential stops and calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

# Muscle Fiber Types and Their Role in Exercise Performance

- **Type I (Slow-Twitch)**: 
  - High endurance, low power, uses aerobic respiration.
  - Good for long-duration, low-intensity activities like marathons.

- **Type IIa (Fast-Twitch, Oxidative)**: 
  - Moderate endurance, moderate power, uses both aerobic and anaerobic pathways.
  - Effective for activities like 400m sprints.

- **Type IIb (Fast-Twitch, Glycolytic)**: 
  - High power, low endurance, relies on anaerobic glycolysis.
  - Used in short, explosive movements like weightlifting or sprinting.

### Application:
- Endurance athletes typically have more Type I fibers, while sprinters or powerlifters benefit from Type II fibers, which generate more force in less time.

# Structure and Function of the Nervous System in Muscle Control

- **Organization**: 
  - The nervous system is divided into:
    - **Central Nervous System (CNS)**
    - **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**
  - Motor neurons in the PNS send signals from the CNS to skeletal muscles.

- **Motor Unit**: 
  - A motor unit consists of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it controls.
  - Recruitment of motor units (from small to large) and rate coding (firing frequency) control muscle force.

- **Proprioceptors**: 
  - **Muscle spindles**: Detect stretch and provide feedback to regulate muscle contractions.
  - **Golgi tendon organs**: Detect tension and protect muscles from injury.

# Role of Exercise in Bone Health and Tendon/Ligament Function

- **Bone Health**: 
  - Weight-bearing and resistance exercises stimulate **osteoblasts** to increase bone mineral density (BMD), helping to prevent osteoporosis.

- **Tendons and Ligaments**: 
  - Tendons connect muscles to bones, and ligaments connect bones to bones. Both provide stability and allow for controlled movement.
  - **Strengthening exercises** (e.g., resistance training) improve the tensile strength of tendons and ligaments, reducing the risk of injury.
