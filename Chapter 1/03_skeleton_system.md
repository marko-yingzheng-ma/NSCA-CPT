# Organization of the Skeletal System (骨骼系统的组织)

- **Two main parts of the skeletal system**:
  - **Axial Skeleton (轴骨架)**: Composed of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage. It provides central support and protection for the brain, spinal cord, and organs within the chest.
  - **Appendicular Skeleton (附肢骨架)**: Composed of limbs and the bones that connect them to the axial skeleton, such as the shoulders, arms, pelvis, and legs.

- **Functions of the Skeletal System**:
  - **Support**: Provides structure and support for the body.
  - **Protection**: Shields vital organs (e.g., skull protects the brain, rib cage protects the heart and lungs).
  - **Movement**: Bones act as levers, and muscles contract to produce movement at joints.
  - **Mineral Storage**: Bones store minerals like calcium and phosphorus.
  - **Blood Cell Production**: Bone marrow produces red and white blood cells.

- **Types of Bone Tissue**:
  - **Compact Bone (致密骨)**: Dense and forms the outer layer of bones; provides strength for weight-bearing.
  - **Spongy Bone (海绵骨)**: Lighter and less dense; found at the ends of long bones and in the vertebrae; contains red bone marrow for blood cell production.

# Osteoporosis and Exercise (骨质疏松症与运动)

## Osteoporosis:
- A condition where bone density decreases, making bones more fragile and prone to fractures.
- Most common in postmenopausal women and older adults.

### Risk Factors for Osteoporosis:
- **Age**: Bone mass naturally decreases with age.
- **Gender**: Women are at higher risk, especially after menopause due to lower estrogen levels.
- **Family History**: Genetics play a role in bone density.
- **Diet**: Insufficient calcium and vitamin D intake can contribute to bone loss.
- **Sedentary Lifestyle**: Lack of weight-bearing exercise weakens bones.

### Role of Exercise in Preventing Osteoporosis:
- **Weight-bearing Exercise** (e.g., walking, running, resistance training) stimulates bone formation and increases bone density.
- **Strength Training**: Helps increase bone mineral density (BMD) and strengthen muscles, which in turn support bones.
- **Balance and Coordination**: Exercises that improve balance (e.g., yoga, Pilates) can help prevent falls and fractures.

### How Exercise Helps:
- **Mechanical Load**: Weight-bearing activities apply mechanical force to bones, encouraging bone remodeling (resorption and deposition of bone).
- **Stimulating Bone Cells**: Exercise activates osteoblasts (bone-forming cells), increasing bone density.

# Tendons and Ligaments (肌腱和韧带)

## Tendons (肌腱):
- Connect muscles to bones.
- **Structure**: Tendons are composed of collagen fibers that provide tensile strength to resist pulling forces.
- **Function**: Tendons transmit the force generated by muscles to bones, allowing movement at the joints.

## Ligaments (韧带):
- Connect bones to other bones at joints.
- **Structure**: Ligaments are made of collagen fibers, though they are more elastic than tendons to allow for some flexibility in joint movement.
- **Function**: Ligaments stabilize joints, prevent excessive movement, and support overall joint function.

## Injury and Repair:
- Both tendons and ligaments can be subject to strain (overstretching) and sprains (partial or complete tear). Proper warm-up and stretching before intense activity can reduce the risk of injury.
- **Tendonitis**: Inflammation of the tendon due to overuse, often occurring in athletes and individuals who perform repetitive movements.
- **Ligament Sprains**: Occurs when the ligament is stretched beyond its capacity, often due to sudden twists or turns.

## Exercise and Tendons/Ligaments Health:
- **Strengthening**: Regular exercise increases the strength of tendons and ligaments, helping to prevent injuries. Resistance training helps improve tendon and ligament function by promoting collagen production.
- **Flexibility**: Stretching exercises can help maintain the elasticity of tendons and ligaments, reducing the risk of strains and sprains.
- **Rehabilitation**: After injury, specific rehabilitation exercises help to restore tendon and ligament strength and function.

# Summary:
- **Organization of the skeletal system**: Divided into axial and appendicular skeletons; functions include support, protection, movement, mineral storage, and blood cell production.
- **Osteoporosis**: A condition of low bone density, which can be managed and prevented with weight-bearing exercise, strength training, and proper nutrition.
- **Tendons and ligaments**: Tendons connect muscles to bones, while ligaments connect bones to bones at joints. Both play crucial roles in movement and joint stability and can be strengthened or injured with proper or improper exercise.
