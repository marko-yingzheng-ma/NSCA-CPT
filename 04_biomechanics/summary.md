# Biomechanics of Resistance Exercise

Resistance exercise plays a fundamental role in developing strength, power, endurance, and hypertrophy. The biomechanical principles of resistance training help trainers understand how different resistance devices affect the muscles and movement. This section covers **constant-resistance devices**, **variable-resistance devices**, **accommodating-resistance devices**, and **performing exercises in the water**.

## **1. Describe human movements using appropriate anatomical and mechanical terminology.**

Human movement can be described using both **anatomical** and **mechanical** terminology to understand the actions at various joints and the forces involved in these movements. Hereâ€™s how:

- **Anatomical Terminology**:
  - **Flexion**: A decrease in the angle between two body parts (e.g., bending the elbow or knee).
  - **Extension**: An increase in the angle between two body parts (e.g., straightening the elbow or knee).
  - **Abduction**: Movement away from the midline of the body (e.g., raising the arm sideways).
  - **Adduction**: Movement towards the midline of the body (e.g., lowering the arm back to the side).
  - **Medial/Lateral Rotation**: Rotation of a limb toward or away from the midline.

- **Mechanical Terminology**:
  - **Torque**: The rotational force around a joint, often influenced by the moment arm (distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force).
  - **Moment Arm**: The perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force (e.g., how far the weight is from the joint during a bicep curl).
  - **Force**: The push or pull exerted by muscles, typically measured in Newtons.

## **2. Apply mechanical concepts to human movement problems.**

Mechanical concepts like **force**, **torque**, **moment arm**, and **leverage** can be applied to understanding human movement problems:

- **Torque and Moment Arms**: During exercises like squats or biceps curls, the moment arm changes as the limb moves, affecting the torque at the joint. By increasing or decreasing the moment arm, a trainer can influence how difficult the exercise is at various points of the movement.
- **Leverage**: The body acts as a system of levers (1st, 2nd, and 3rd class) in movements. For example, during a bench press (a 3rd-class lever), the effort is applied between the fulcrum (the shoulder joint) and the load (the weight).
- **Mechanical Advantage**: The body uses bones and joints as levers. A longer moment arm can provide greater mechanical advantage, helping muscles generate more force at a joint.

## **3. Understand the factors contributing to human strength and power.**

Several factors contribute to human strength and power:

- **Muscle Cross-sectional Area**: The larger the muscle's cross-sectional area, the greater its potential for force production. More muscle fibers mean more capacity for generating strength.
- **Fiber Type**: **Type II (fast-twitch)** fibers are more capable of generating high amounts of force and power compared to **Type I (slow-twitch)** fibers, which are more endurance-oriented.
- **Neuromuscular Efficiency**: The ability to recruit motor units effectively contributes to strength. A person with better neuromuscular efficiency can activate more fibers at once to produce more force.
- **Leverage**: Mechanical advantage also plays a role. In exercises like squats, varying the stance or technique can alter the moment arm and the amount of force required.
- **Power**: Power is a combination of strength and speed. It is determined by force production and how quickly it is applied. High-speed movements like Olympic lifts emphasize power, while slow-strength movements focus more on maximizing force.

## **4. Determine the muscle actions involved in movement tasks.**

- **Concentric Actions**: Muscle shortens as it generates force (e.g., lifting a weight during a bicep curl).
- **Eccentric Actions**: Muscle lengthens under tension (e.g., slowly lowering the weight back down during a bicep curl).
- **Isometric Actions**: The muscle generates force but does not change length (e.g., holding a plank position).
- For example, in a squat:
  - **Quadriceps** perform **concentric contraction** during the upward phase (extension of the knee).
  - **Hamstrings** and **gluteus maximus** work eccentrically during the downward phase (controlling knee flexion and hip flexion).

## **5. Analyze biomechanical aspects of resistance exercises.**

Biomechanical analysis of resistance exercises involves understanding how **force** and **torque** are applied and how different **resistance devices** affect the body:

- **Free Weights**: Resistance remains constant, but the torque changes throughout the movement because the moment arm changes with limb position. For example, in a biceps curl, the resistance is greatest when the forearm is horizontal, and it decreases at the top of the movement.
- **Machines**: Provide variable resistance, adjusting throughout the movement. For example, a leg press machine may offer more resistance when the knee is fully extended and less resistance at the start of the movement. This helps match the muscle's strength curve, providing more resistance where the muscle is stronger.
- **Variable Resistance Devices (Elastic Bands/Chains)**: These devices change the resistance as the movement progresses. For example, with chains, as the lifter moves through the exercise, more chain lifts off the floor, adding resistance. Elastic bands increase resistance as they stretch, making exercises harder at the top of the movement.
- **Fluid and Flywheel Resistance**: Machines using fluid or flywheel resistance (e.g., flywheel devices or hydraulic equipment) change resistance based on the speed and acceleration of the movement. The faster the movement, the greater the resistance applied.

### **Summary**

By applying **anatomical** and **mechanical terminology**, we can describe and analyze human movement, providing valuable insights into exercise biomechanics. Concepts like **torque**, **moment arm**, and **muscle actions** are essential to understanding how force is produced during exercises. The study of **human strength and power** involves understanding **muscle physiology**, **leverage**, and **neuromuscular efficiency**, all of which influence how we design effective resistance training programs.
