# Plyometric and Speed Training Program Design and Technique

## 1 PLYOMETRIC MECHANICS AND PHYSIOLOGY

### Key Concepts & Exam Focus

- **Stretch-Shortening Cycle (SSC)**: The fundamental physiological mechanism behind plyometrics that involves **rapid eccentric loading** followed immediately by **explosive concentric contraction**. This cycle enhances power output through two primary mechanisms: 
  - **Elastic Energy Storage**: Muscle-tendon units store kinetic energy during the eccentric phase like a spring.
  - **Stretch Reflex Activation**: Muscle spindles are stimulated by rapid stretch, triggering a reflexive contraction.

- **Three Phases of SSC**: 
  - **Eccentric (Loading) Phase**: Pre-stretch phase where muscle is stretched and elastic energy is stored.
  - **Amortization (Transition) Phase**: The **most critical phase** where pause between eccentric and concentric must be **brief** (<0.2 seconds) to prevent dissipation of stored energy as heat.
  - **Concentric (Unloading) Phase**: Release of stored elastic energy combined with voluntary contraction produces greater force output.

*Table: Phases of the Stretch-Shortening Cycle*
| **Phase** | **Duration** | **Key Actions** | **Training Emphasis** |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Eccentric | Variable | Muscle stretching, energy storage | Control and precision |
| Amortization | <0.2 seconds | Transition between phases | Minimize transition time |
| Concentric | Explosive | Energy release, powerful contraction | Maximal force output |

### Critical Statistics & Specifics

- **Amortization Phase Timing**: Must be **≤0.2 seconds** for optimal energy transfer. Longer transitions decrease power output significantly .
- **Force Production**: SSC can increase force production by **10-30%** compared to concentric-only movements .

### Technique & Safety Precautions

- **Emphasis on Quick Transitions**: Cue clients to "**jump immediately upon landing**" rather than pausing.
- **Progressive Implementation**: Begin with **jump-landing drills** before progressing to rebound movements.

### Study Question Integration

- The mechanical model of plyometric exercise consists of **series elastic** (tendons, fascia), **parallel** (muscle tissue), and **contractile** (actin, myosin) components. **Mechanical** is not a component (Answer D to Question 1) .

## 6 SPEED TRAINING MECHANICS AND PHYSIOLOGY

### Key Concepts & Exam Focus

- **Speed Definition**: The ability to achieve **high velocity** through optimal stride length and frequency .
- **Stride Characteristics**:
  - **Initial Acceleration**: More dependent on **stride length** (powerful ground forces)
  - **Maximum Velocity**: More dependent on **stride frequency** (rapid limb turnover)

Here are the answers to the study questions based on the NSCA Essentials of Personal Training, 3rd Edition, Chapter 17.

**Question 1**
Correct Answer: D. mechanical

**Textbook Reference**:
"The mechanical model of plyometric exercise describes the body's ability to store and release elastic energy and consists of three components: the series elastic component (SEC), the parallel elastic component (PEC), and the contractile component (CC)." (Chapter 17, "Plyometric Mechanics and Physiology")

Incorrect Options:
*   A. series elastic: This is a correct component of the model, representing the tendons and fascia that act like springs to store elastic energy.
*   B. parallel: This is a correct component of the model, referring to the muscle tissue itself (e.g., epimysium, perimysium, endomysium, sarcolemma) that provides a parallel elastic element.
*   C. contractile: This is a correct component of the model, representing the actin and myosin filaments that are responsible for the contractile force of the muscle.

**Question 2**
Correct Answer: A. true

**Textbook Reference**:
"For lower body plyometrics, participants should possess a strength level of approximately 1.5 times their body weight for a one-repetition maximum (1RM) back squat." (Chapter 17, "Minimum Requirements for Participation in a Plyometric Training Program")

Incorrect Options:
*   B. false: This is incorrect because the textbook explicitly states that a 1.5x body weight squat is a recommended minimum strength prerequisite for safely handling the high forces involved in lower body plyometric exercises.

**Question 3**
Correct Answer: B. *increase* the client’s weight

**Textbook Reference**:
"Intensity [of plyometric drills] can be increased by... adding external weight or resistance (e.g., weight vest, bands)... However, external resistance should not exceed 10% of the client's body weight." (Chapter 17, "Plyometric Program Design")

Incorrect Options:
*   A. *decrease* the height of the drill: Decreasing the height of a box for a depth jump, for example, would *decrease* the intensity by reducing the eccentric load and impact forces.
*   C. *increase* the client’s points of contact with the ground: Increasing points of contact (e.g., going from a single-leg to a double-leg hop) *decreases* intensity by distributing force and making the exercise more stable.
*   D. *decrease* the speed of the drill: The essence of plyometrics is high velocity. Decreasing speed lengthens the amortization phase, reduces the stretch reflex, and dissipates elastic energy, thereby *decreasing* the intensity and effectiveness of the drill.

**Question 4**
Correct Answer: C. stride length; stride frequency

**Textbook Reference**:
"During initial acceleration (0 to 10 m [0 to 33 ft]), stride length is the primary determinant of velocity. As running velocity approaches maximum speed, stride frequency becomes the most important factor." (Chapter 17, "Speed Training Mechanics and Physiology")

Incorrect Options:
*   A. stride length; stride length: Stride length is crucial for acceleration but is not the primary factor for achieving top speed.
*   B. stride frequency; stride length: Stride frequency is more critical for top speed, not stride length. Stride length is more important for the start.
*   D. stride frequency; stride frequency: Stride frequency is critical for top speed, but it is not the most dependent factor for the initial start and acceleration phase.

**Question 5**
Correct Answer: B. Plyometric training should be performed *after* aerobic training.

**Textbook Reference**:
"Plyometric and speed training sessions should be performed before aerobic endurance training... If plyometric or speed training is conducted after endurance training, the resulting fatigue may impair the quality of exercise technique and the ability to develop speed and power, while also potentially increasing the risk of injury." (Chapter 17, "Combining Plyometrics and Speed Training with Other Forms of Exercise")

Incorrect Options:
*   A. Aerobic exercise may have a negative effect on power production: This is correct. Chronic, prolonged aerobic endurance training can induce neuromuscular adaptations that are detrimental to power development.
*   C. Adding low-intensity bounding-type drills to non-running days may improve long-distance running performance: This is correct. This strategy can improve running economy and power without interfering with aerobic development on recovery days.
*   D. Many sports and activities require both a power and an aerobic component: This is correct. This is the fundamental reason why many athletes need to train both energy systems.
