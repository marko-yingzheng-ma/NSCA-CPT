## Vital Signs
- **Purpose:** Establish safety baseline, identify contraindications, and inform exercise intensity and monitoring.
- **Measurements:**
  - **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** 
    - Palpation Procedure
      - HR should be counted for 6, 10, 15, 30, or 60 seconds. If the HR is counted for less than a full minute, use the multipliers to convert the measurement to beats per minute
      - shorter-duration HR counts (6, 10, and 15 seconds) are used during exercise and postexercise conditions, RHR is generally assessed with 30 or 60 seconds to reduce error.
  - **Blood Pressure (BP):** Use sphygmomanometer and stethoscope (Korotkoff sounds). Client seated, rested for 5 minutes, arm at heart level. Inflate ~20 mmHg above expected SBP (~160 mmHg), deflate slowly (2–3 mmHg/sec). Record SBP at first sound and DBP at sound disappearance. Repeat after 2 minutes; take a third reading if differing by >5 mmHg.

## Training Load
- **Definitions:**
  - **External Load:** Objective workload (sets × reps, distance, volume).
  - **Internal Load:** Client’s physiological or perceptual response (RPE, well-being).
- **Application:** Track both to guide programming, ensure proper progression, and manage fatigue.

## Body Composition
- **Purpose:** Assess health risk, track progress; note BMI limitations.
- **Methods:**
  - **Anthropometry:** 
    - Height: using stadiometer
    - weight: most common using platform-beam scale
    - BMI: weight/height^2. Not accurate for muscular people
  - **Skinfolds:** Measure at eight sites (chest, midaxilla, triceps, subscapular, abdomen, suprailium, thigh, medial calf) at RIGHT side. Take at least two readings per site; if >2 mm or >10% difference, take a third. Record after 1–2 seconds.
      - accuracy can be affected by:
        - skill level of the technician
        - caliper used, client factors 
        - prediction equation used to estimate %BF.

  - **Waist-to-Hip Ratio:** Measure smallest waist and largest hip girths; calculate ratio for disease risk assessment.
  - **BIA & NIR:** Quick body fat estimates; sensitive to hydration and less accurate than skinfolds.

## Cardiovascular Endurance
- **Purpose:** Submaximal Tests to estimate VO₂max to prescribe safe and effective intensity.
- **Cycle Ergometer – YMCA Test:** Multiple 3-minute stages at 50 rpm. Adjust workload based on HR until client reaches ~85% HRmax.
- **Åstrand–Rhyming Test:** Single-stage, 6-minute test at 50 rpm; increase workload until HR ≥120 bpm; use HR in minutes 5–6 for VO₂max estimation.
  
- **Field Tests:**
  - **YMCA Step Test:** Step at fixed cadence for 3 minutes; measure 1-minute HR recovery.
  - **Distance Tests:** 12-minute run/walk, 1.5-mile run, Rockport Walk Test, or 1-mile run; use distance, time, and HR to estimate VO₂max.
    - Rockport for older or sedendary clients
    - 1 mile run for children 6 - 17

## Speed & Agility
- **Assessments:**
  - **Straight-Line Sprint:** maximal speed and acceleration.
  - **Shuttle Runs:**  indicator of anaerobic capacity 
  - **Agility Tests:**
    - **T-Test:** Incorporates forward sprint, lateral shuffles, and backpedal in a T formation. No feet crossing allowed. 
    - **Pro-Agility (5–10–5):** Short shuttle involving rapid changes of direction.

---

## Muscular Strength
- **Definition:** Maximal force output, often measured via 1RM.
- **Protocols:**
  - **1RM Testing:** After warm-up, perform progressively heavier single reps with 2–4 minutes rest until 1RM is reached. Use proper technique and spotting.
  - **Relative Strength:** Express strength relative to body weight.
  - **Alternative:** Use multi-rep testing and prediction equations when 1RM is contraindicated.

---

## Muscular Power
- **Definition:** Ability to exert force rapidly (force × velocity).
- **Tests:**
  - **Vertical Jump:** Measure height as difference between standing reach and jump reach.
  - **Standing Long Jump (Broad Jump):** Horizontal power test.
  - **Medicine-Ball Chest Pass:** Upper-body power using standardized ball and technique.
- **Protocol Tips:** Use familiarization, consistent surface, and report best of multiple trials.

---

## Muscular Endurance
- **Definition:** Muscle’s ability to perform repeated contractions with submaximal load.
- **Tests:**
  - **YMCA Bench Press:** Men = 80 lb, Women = 35 lb; cadence ~30 reps/min; to failure.
  - ** SIT-UP, Partial Curl-Up Test:** abdominal muscles.
  - **Prone Double Straight-Leg Raise:** Hold position as long as possible for lower-back endurance.

---

## Flexibility
- **Definition:** Range of motion available at a joint.
- **Tests:**
  - **Sit-and-Reach Test:** Use box or ruler; measure forward reach from a seated, leg-extended position. Apply normative tables. hip and low back flexibility.
  - **Back Stretch Test:**  indication of upper body flexibility and shoulder range of motion,

---

## Postural Alignment & Movement Assessments
- **Static Posture:** Observe head, shoulders, spine, pelvis, knees, and ankles from front, side, and back for alignment and asymmetries.
- **Movement Screens:**
  - **Overhead Squat or similar:** Detect compensation patterns and identify muscle imbalances.
  - **Single-Leg Squat / Gait / Push-Pull Screen:** Evaluate dynamic control and symmetry.
- **Application:** Use findings to guide corrective exercise, prioritize mobility/stability work, and document changes.

---

## Reliability & Safety Notes (Cross-sectional)
- **Standardization:** Testing at the same time of day, clothing, hydration, and prior activity improves reliability.
- **Familiarization:** Practice trials reduce learning effects, especially for technically demanding tests.
- **Accuracy Tools:** Electronic timing, contact mats, and force plates enhance precision; if unavailable, use consistent manual timing with multiple trials.
- **Termination Criteria:** Stop testing for chest pain, dizziness, excessively elevated BP, or other warning signals.

### Question 1

**Correct Answer:** C. A personal trainer will only measure them in the rested state.

**Textbook Reference:**  
Vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure are measured in the rested state to obtain accurate baseline readings and can be used to determine exercise intensity and guide program design.

**Incorrect Options:**
- A. Vital signs include heart rate – *Correct; heart rate is a primary vital sign.*
- B. Vital signs include blood pressure – *Correct; blood pressure is also a primary vital sign.*
- D. They can be used to determine exercise intensity – *Correct; trainers use vital signs to assess and adjust exercise intensity.*

### Question 2

**Correct Answer:** B. suprailium

**Textbook Reference:**  
For a 45-year-old male client, the three-site skinfold test includes the chest, abdomen, and thigh. The suprailiac (suprailium) site is not part of this standard male three-site assessment.

**Incorrect Options:**
- A. chest – *Correct; chest is one of the typical sites.*
- C. abdomen – *Correct; abdomen is another standard site.*
- D. thigh – *Correct; thigh is the third standard site.*

---

### Question 3

**Correct Answer:** B. Crossing of the feet during the shuffle is allowed. *(This is incorrect; crossing is not allowed.)*

**Textbook Reference:**  
In the T-test, crossing the feet during the shuffle is not permitted because it compromises agility, accuracy, and test validity.

**Incorrect Options:**
- A. The first 10 yards is a forward sprint – *Correct; that is how the test begins.*
- C. The client shuffles to the left for a total of 10 yards – *Correct; this movement is part of the protocol.*
- D. The client shuffles to the right for a total of 10 yards – *Correct; that is also included in the test.*

---

### Question 4

**Correct Answer:** A. flexibility

**Textbook Reference:**  
Flexibility refers to the range of motion around a joint or series of joints.

**Incorrect Options:**
- B. laxity – *Refers to joint looseness or instability, not range of motion.*
- C. dynamic stability – *Involves controlling joint movement during motion, not simply range of motion.*
- D. stiffness – *Relates to resistance to movement, not the extent of motion.*

---

### Question 5

**Correct Answer:** A. The number of repetitions performed are used to score the test.

**Textbook Reference:**  
The single-leg squat and forward step-down tests are not scored by repetition count; instead, they assess movement quality—including strength, proprioception, neuromuscular control, and joint range of motion.

**Incorrect Options:**
- B. Used to assess movement quality in the lower limb. – *True, but this is not the correct answer per the user’s specification.*
- C. The forward step-down procedure provides an alternative for less-conditioned individuals. – *Misleading; both tests evaluate movement quality and the literature does not standardize one as specifically for less-conditioned clients.*
- D. They require strength, proprioception, neuromuscular control, and adequate range of motion. – *Correct in terms of qualities assessed, but does not address scoring.*
