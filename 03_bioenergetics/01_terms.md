1. **Energy**: The capacity to perform physical work, necessary for all biological functions, including muscle contraction and movement.
2. **Bioenergetics**: The study of how energy flows through living systems, particularly the conversion of food (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) into biologically usable forms of energy.
3. **Chemical Energy**: Energy stored in food molecules (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) that can be converted into mechanical energy for movement.
4. **Catabolic Reactions**: The breakdown of large molecules into smaller ones (e.g., carbohydrates into glucose), usually releasing energy in the process.
5. **Anabolic Reactions**: The process of building larger molecules from smaller ones (e.g., forming proteins from amino acids), which requires energy input.
6. **Metabolism**: The total of all the catabolic and anabolic reactions in the body. It is the sum of processes that break down molecules to release energy and use that energy to build new molecules.
7. **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**: A high-energy molecule composed of adenine, ribose, and three phosphate groups. ATP is the primary energy carrier in cells, used to power cellular functions, including muscle contractions.
8. **Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)**: Formed when one phosphate group is removed from ATP, releasing energy in the process.
9. **Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP)**: Formed when a second phosphate group is removed from ADP, further releasing energy.
10. **Phosphate Bonds**: The bonds between phosphate groups in ATP are high-energy bonds. Breaking these bonds releases energy for cellular activities.
11. **ATP Resynthesis**: The process of regenerating ATP from ADP and AMP to ensure a constant supply of ATP for muscle contractions and other bodily functions.
