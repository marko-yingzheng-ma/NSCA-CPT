# Cardiovascular System

### 1. **What are the anatomical characteristics of the cardiovascular system?**
- The cardiovascular system consists of the **heart**, **blood vessels**, and **blood**.
- The heart is a muscular organ with **four chambers**:
  - Two **atria** (心房)
  - Two **ventricles** (心室)
- Blood circulates through two main circulatory routes:
  - **Systemic circulation** (体循环)
  - **Pulmonary circulation** (肺循环)
- The heart valves (e.g., **mitral valve** (二尖瓣), **tricuspid valve** (三尖瓣)) control the direction of blood flow, preventing backflow.

### 2. **What are the physiological characteristics of the cardiovascular system?**
- The heart pumps blood to deliver **oxygen (O₂)** and nutrients to tissues and remove **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** and waste products.
- The **heart rate** (心率), **stroke volume** (每搏输出量), and **cardiac output** (心输出量) regulate how much blood is pumped per minute.
- The **cardiac cycle** (心脏周期) involves:
  - **Systole** (收缩期) – contraction phase
  - **Diastole** (舒张期) – relaxation phase
- The cardiac cycle is controlled by **electrical impulses**.

# Electrical Conduction System of the Heart and Electrocardiogram

### 3. **How does the electrical conduction system of the heart function?**
- The electrical conduction system controls the rhythm of the heartbeat.
- Key components:
  - **SA node** (窦房结): Generates electrical impulses that initiate each heartbeat, setting the rhythm.
  - **AV node** (房室结): Receives the impulse from the SA node.
  - **Bundle of His** (希氏束) and **Purkinje fibers** (浦肯野纤维): Transmit the impulse throughout the ventricles, causing contraction.

### 4. **What is an electrocardiogram (ECG) and its components?**
- An **ECG** (心电图) records the electrical activity of the heart.
- Key components:
  - **P wave (P波)**: Represents **atrial depolarization** (心房去极化), occurring when the impulse travels from the SA node to the AV node.
  - **QRS complex (QRS波群)**: Represents **ventricular depolarization** (心室去极化), occurring when the impulse moves through the AV node to the ventricles.
  - **T wave (T波)**: Represents **ventricular repolarization** (心室复极化).

# Mechanisms that Control Blood Circulation

### 5. **What mechanisms control blood circulation throughout the body?**
- The circulatory system is regulated by the following mechanisms:
  - **Autonomic nervous system** (自主神经系统): Controls **vasoconstriction** (血管收缩) and **vasodilation** (血管扩张) to manage blood flow.
  - **Baroreceptor reflex** (压力感受器反射): Helps maintain blood pressure by adjusting heart rate and blood vessel diameter.
  - **Blood flow redistribution during exercise**:
    - **Skeletal muscle arteriole dilation** (骨骼肌小动脉扩张)
    - **Nonactive organ arteriole constriction** (非活跃器官小动脉收缩)
    - Directs blood to active muscles while reducing blood flow to non-essential organs.

# Respiratory System

### 6. **What are the anatomical characteristics of the respiratory system?**
- The **upper respiratory tract** (上呼吸道) includes the **nose**, **pharynx**, and **larynx**, which warm, filter, and humidify air.
- The **lower respiratory tract** (下呼吸道) includes the **trachea** (气管), **bronchi** (支气管), and **lungs** (肺).
- The **lungs** contain **alveoli** (肺泡), where gas exchange occurs.

### 7. **What are the physiological characteristics of the respiratory system?**
- The primary function is to bring **oxygen** into the body and remove **carbon dioxide**.
- **Tidal volume** (潮气量): The volume of air inhaled or exhaled during normal breathing.
- **Residual volume** (残气量): The air left in the lungs after maximal exhalation.

# Gas Exchange and Respiratory Mechanisms

### 8. **How does gas exchange occur between the lungs and blood?**
- Gas exchange happens in the **alveoli** (肺泡):
  - **Oxygen (O₂)** from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin alveolar walls into the blood, binding to **hemoglobin** (血红蛋白) in red blood cells.
  - **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** from the blood diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled.
- **Partial pressure** (分压) differences drive diffusion:
  - **O₂** moves from areas of **high partial pressure** in the alveoli to **low partial pressure** in the blood.
  - **CO₂** moves in the opposite direction.

### 9. **How is respiration controlled in the body?**
- **Respiratory control** is managed by the **medulla oblongata** (延髓) and **pons** (脑桥) in the brainstem.
- These areas monitor blood **CO₂** levels and adjust the **rate** and **depth** of breathing.
- **Chemoreceptors** (化学感受器) in blood vessels sense changes in **CO₂** and **O₂** levels, signaling the brain to adjust breathing rates.
- During **exercise**, the **rate of breathing** (呼吸频率) increases to meet the body’s higher oxygen demand.
