## FACTORS INFLUENCING ADAPTATIONS  

### Specificity  
- Adaptations match training mode/velocity (e.g., free weights improve free-weight performance more than isokinetic machines).  

### Sex  
- **Strength differences**: Primarily due to muscle mass (upper body > lower body).  
- **Per unit muscle**: Force production is similar between sexes.  

### Age  
- **Sarcopenia**: Age-related muscle loss (↓ Type II fibers, strength, power).  
- **Elderly**: Can ↑ strength (up to 200%) and BMD with resistance training.  

### Genetics  
- **ACTN3 gene**: "Strength gene" (RR/RX genotypes common in elite powerlifters), but **XX carriers still adapt well to training** (Study Q4: **A is incorrect**).  
  - ACTN3 codes for Z-line protein in Type II fibers (Study Q4: **C is correct**).  
  - No health risks for XX carriers (Study Q4: **D is correct**).
