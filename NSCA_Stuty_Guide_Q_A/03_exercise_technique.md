## **III. TECHNIQUES OF EXERCISE**

#### **» Identify the key differences between constant-resistance, variable-resistance, and accommodating-resistance devices and how these differences determine the selection of a device for a safe and effective program (EPT2, Ch. 4).**

*   **Constant-Resistance Devices:** Provide the same magnitude of resistance throughout the entire range of motion (ROM). The force required to move the load changes due to variations in mechanical advantage (moment arm), but the weight itself is constant.
    *   **Examples:** Free weights (barbells, dumbbells), some machines (e.g., pulldown with a single pulley, Smith machine).
    *   **Selection Rationale:** Mimic real-world objects, require more stabilization, and are effective for building general strength. The changing torque matches the human strength curve in some movements (e.g., hardest at the start of a bicep curl).

*   **Variable-Resistance Devices:** Provide a resistance force that increases or decreases throughout the ROM. The absolute load changes to match the strength curve of a muscle, aiming to provide more challenge where the user is mechanically strongest.
    *   **Examples:** Cam-based machines, elastic bands/tubes, chains attached to a barbell.
    *   **Selection Rationale:** Can allow for overload at stronger joint angles and may be useful for targeting specific points in the ROM. Bands and chains are portable and inexpensive.

*   **Accommodating-Resistance Devices:** Provide a resistance that is proportional to the force applied by the user. The harder the user pushes, the more resistance is generated.
    *   **Examples:** Isokinetic dynamometers, hydraulic machines, pneumatic machines, flywheels.
    *   **Selection Rationale:** Allows for maximal effort at all points in the ROM and at high speeds without the risk of momentum overcoming the user. Often used in rehabilitation and for testing. They are generally very safe as the resistance accommodates the user's force output.

#### **» Explain the recommendations for breathing during resistance training and variations for optimal performance.**

*   **General Recommendation:** Exhale through the sticking point (the most difficult part) of the concentric phase and inhale during the easier eccentric phase.
*   **Verbal Cue:** "Breathe out during the hardest part of the exercise and breathe in during the easier part."
*   **Variation for Advanced Clients/Structural Exercises:** For exercises that load the spine (e.g., squats, deadlifts) or use heavy loads, a brief **Valsalva maneuver** can be used. The client inhales before or during the eccentric phase, holds their breath through the sticking point of the concentric phase to stabilize the spine, and then exhales once past the sticking point.

#### **» Describe the Valsalva maneuver, the benefits and risks involved, and for whom it is contraindicated.**

*   **Description:** A breathing practice where the glottis is closed to keep air from escaping the lungs while the muscles of the abdomen and rib cage contract. The individual is essentially trying to exhale against a closed throat.
*   **Benefits:** Generates intra-abdominal pressure that supports the vertebral column internally, helping to maintain correct posture and body alignment and significantly reducing the compressive forces on the spine during heavy lifting.
*   **Risks:** Causes a sharp increase in intra-thoracic pressure, which can exert compressive forces on the heart, impede venous return, and momentarily raise blood pressure to very high levels. This can cause dizziness, disorientation, blood vessel rupture, or blackouts.
*   **Contraindications:** **Should not be permitted** for clients with any known or suspected cardiovascular, metabolic, or respiratory condition. Even for healthy clients, breath should only be held momentarily (1-2 seconds).

#### **» Identify the recommendations for use of a weightlifting belt.**

*   **Recommended For:** Ground-based structural exercises that load the trunk and place stress on the lower back (e.g., back squat, front squat, deadlift, standing shoulder press) **and** involve lifting **maximal or near-maximal loads**. Both conditions must be met.
*   **Not Recommended For:** Exercises that do not directly load the trunk (e.g., lat pulldown, bench press, biceps curl, leg extension), even if they stress the lower back, or when using light loads.
*   **Rationale:** A belt increases intra-abdominal pressure, which can decrease compressive forces on the spine. However, overuse can lead to deconditioning of the core stabilizers (transversus abdominis, etc.).

#### **» Why should a personal trainer spot a client performing resistance training exercises?**

The primary responsibility is **client safety**. A spotter is used to physically assist clients in completing an exercise to help protect them from injury, typically when using free weights where bars, dumbbells, and plates are not restricted to a fixed movement path and could fall on the client.

#### **» How does the speed of movement affect the performance of an exercise?**

*   **Force-Velocity Relationship:** During concentric actions, faster muscle shortening velocities are associated with lower force production. Slower, controlled movements allow for greater force production.
*   **Power Output:** Power (Force × Velocity) is maximized when a high force is generated at a high velocity. For power development, exercises must be performed explosively.
*   **Safety and Control:** Jerky, uncontrolled movements are inefficient and increase injury risk. Proper speed ensures the targeted muscles control the movement throughout the ROM.
*   **Exercise Classification:** Slow, controlled movements are characteristic of strength exercises (e.g., powerlifting), while high-velocity movements are characteristic of power exercises (e.g., Olympic lifts).

#### **» List the resistance training exercises that should be spotted and explain how a personal trainer should spot the client performing the exercise.**

*   **Exercises That Require Spotting:**
    1.  **Overhead exercises** (e.g., standing shoulder press)
    2.  **Over-the-face exercises** (e.g., bench press, lying triceps extension)
    3.  **Exercises with the bar on the back or front shoulders** (e.g., back squat, front squat)
*   **How to Spot:**
    *   **Barbell Exercises (e.g., Bench Press):** The spotter should use an **alternated grip** inside the client's hands on the bar, stand close with a staggered stance and neutral spine, and follow the bar throughout the movement, assisting only when necessary.
    *   **Dumbbell Exercises (e.g., Overhead Press):** The spotter should grasp the client's **wrists**, very near the dumbbell—**not the upper arms or elbows**—to safely control the weight if the client fails.
    *   **Squat Exercises:** One or two spotters stand at each end of the bar, using a cupped grip under the ends of the bar. They follow the client's movement and are prepared to "hug and lift" the client if they fail.
    *   **Communication:** The client must signal the trainer for a liftoff, indicate if they need help, and signal when the set is complete and the weight needs to be racked.

### **A. Machine Resistance Exercises**

#### **» Why should adjustments be made to the seat height, body and/or limb pads, or both when setting up a client on a machine?**

Adjustments are made to **align the client's joint axes with the machine's axis of rotation**. This ensures the stress is placed correctly on the targeted muscles, maintains correct body alignment, and allows for a safe and effective ROM. Incorrect alignment can lead to ineffective training or injury.

#### **» What are the various hand grip positions when using a resistance training machine?**

The same grip positions as with free weights are used:
*   **Pronated (Overhand) Grip:** Palms down, knuckles up.
*   **Supinated (Underhand) Grip:** Palms up, knuckles down.
*   **Neutral Grip:** Palms facing each other, as in a handshake.
*   **Closed Grip:** Thumb wrapped around the bar/handle.
*   **Open (False) Grip:** Thumb placed next to the fingers, not wrapped around.

#### **» What is the recommended stable body position (e.g., spinal alignment, base of support, points of contact) when standing? Supine? Prone?**

*   **Standing:** Feet flat on the floor at hip- or shoulder-width apart. Knees slightly flexed. Spine neutral, chest up, shoulders back.
*   **Supine (Lying face up on a bench):** **Five-point body contact position:**
    1.  Back of head
    2.  Upper back and rear shoulders
    3.  Lower back and buttocks
    4.  Right foot
    5.  Left foot
*   **Prone (Lying face down on a machine):** Five-point contact is adapted to the position:
    1.  Chin or cheek
    2.  Chest and abdomen
    3.  Hips and front of thighs
    4.  Right hand
    5.  Left hand

#### **» Recognize and teach correct body and limb positions when using machines.**
*(This is best demonstrated practically. The principle is to achieve the stable positions listed above and align joints with the machine's axis.)*

#### **» Recognize and teach correct movement mechanics for the primary machine-based resistance training exercises (e.g., transitioning from beginning to midpoint to finishing positions).**
*(This requires practical demonstration for each specific machine, following the guidelines in Chapter 13 for exercises like Leg Press, Lat Pulldown, etc.)*

#### **» Identify machine-based resistance training exercises that require spotting and the technique that should be used for each.**

While less common than with free weights, spotting on machines is for **assistance, not safety**. A client may need help maintaining proper speed and ROM or with forced repetitions. The spotter would typically assist by pushing or pulling on the machine's movement arm in line with the intended path of motion.

#### **» What actions can be taken to improve safety when training on resistance training machines?**

*   Adjust all seats and pads to fit the client's anthropometrics.
*   Select an appropriate weight that allows for controlled movement.
*   Use a full ROM under control, avoiding jerky motions.
*   Secure all weight pins completely in the weight stack.
*   Ensure the area around the machine is clear.
*   Instruct clients on how to enter and exit the machine safely.

#### **» Describe common errors made by clients when using machine-based resistance training exercises.**

*   Using excessive weight, leading to poor form and jerky movements.
*   Failing to adjust the machine properly, leading to misalignment.
*   Using momentum to swing the weight instead of controlled muscular force.
*   Not using a full ROM (e.g., not extending fully or not lowering the weight completely).
*   Arching the back or lifting the hips off the seat to complete a repetition.
*   Forcefully locking out joints at the end of a movement.

#### **» What recommendations should a personal trainer make to correct these common errors?**

*   Reduce the weight to a load that can be moved with proper technique.
*   Stop and readjust the machine before performing another repetition.
*   Cue for "slow and controlled" movements, especially during the eccentric phase.
*   Demonstrate and cue the desired start and end positions for the ROM.
*   Reinforce maintenance of the stable body position (e.g., "keep your hips on the seat").
*   Instruct to move through the full ROM but to stop just short of joint lockout.

#### **» Identify possible modifications (regressions, progressions) for the primary machine-based resistance training exercises.**

*   **Regression (Easier):** Decrease the weight/resistance. Decrease the ROM. Use a similar machine that provides more stability or a better mechanical match.
*   **Progression (Harder):** Increase the weight/resistance. Increase the number of sets/repetitions. Decrease the rest time. Use a machine that requires more stabilization (e.g., a plate-loaded machine vs. a selectorized one).

#### **» Identify the joint actions and associated muscles for each of the most common machine-based resistance training exercises.**
*(This is detailed extensively in Table 4.2 and the exercise descriptions in Chapter 13. For example, the Leg Extension involves knee extension, primarily training the quadriceps group.)*

#### **» What errors might occur for the most common machine-based resistance training exercises and how can the personal trainer correct them?**
*(Specific errors are listed for each exercise in Chapter 13. For example, a common error on the Leg Extension is "swinging the legs or jerking the torso backward to help raise the weight." The correction is to reduce the weight and cue for a controlled movement using only the quadriceps.)*

### **B. Free Weight Exercises**

#### **» Why are free weights preferable to machines?**

Free weights are often preferable because they:
*   Allow unrestricted movement in all planes of motion (not just a fixed path).
*   Require the recruitment of stabilizer muscles to control the weight.
*   Are more easily adjusted to individual anthropometrics (limb length, etc.).
*   Mimic real-world and sport-specific movements more closely, leading to better functional carryover.
*   Are versatile; a single barbell or set of dumbbells can be used for a vast number of exercises.

#### **» What are the various hand grip positions when using barbells or dumbbells?**

*   **Pronated (Overhand) Grip**
*   **Supinated (Underhand) Grip**
*   **Neutral Grip** (common with dumbbells)
*   **Alternated (Mixed) Grip:** One hand pronated, one supinated (used for heavy deadlifts and for spotting).
*   **Hook Grip:** A secure grip where the fingers wrap over the thumb (common in Olympic lifting).
*   **Closed Grip** vs. **Open (False) Grip**

#### **» Grip Widths:**
*   **Common (Shoulder-Width)**
*   **Wide**
*   **Narrow (Close)**

#### **» Describe and discuss stable body positions allowing for the maintenance of correct body alignment (e.g., spinal alignment, base of support, points of contact) and placement of stress on the targeted muscles when standing? Supine? Prone?**
*(The stable positions are identical to those described in the machine section: a braced, neutral spine stance for standing exercises, and the five-point contact for supine and prone positions. Maintaining these positions is critical to ensure the stress is on the target muscles and not on compensating joints like the spine.)*

#### **» Recognize and teach correct body and limb positions for the primary free weight exercises.**
*(This requires practical demonstration for exercises like the Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift, emphasizing the key points from Chapter 13.)*

#### **» Recognize and teach correct movement mechanics for the primary free weight exercises (e.g., transitioning from beginning to midpoint to finishing positions).**
*(This requires practical demonstration, following the "Upward Movement Phase" and "Downward Movement Phase" instructions for each exercise in Chapter 13.)*

#### **» Identify free weight exercises that require spotting and the technique that should be used for each.**
*(This was comprehensively answered in the main section above under "List the resistance training exercises that should be spotted...")*

#### **» What actions can be taken to improve safety when training with free weights?**

*   Always use spotters for overhead, over-the-face, and heavy structural exercises.
*   Perform power exercises (cleans, snatches) in a segregated area without a spotter; teach clients to safely miss a lift by pushing the bar away or dropping it.
*   Use collars on barbells to secure weight plates.
*   Keep the training area organized and free of clutter.
*   Check equipment for damage before use.
*   Teach and reinforce proper breathing techniques.

#### **» Describe common errors made by clients when performing the primary free weight exercises.**

*   **Squat:** Allowing the knees to cave in (valgus), heels to lift off the floor, or the torso to flex excessively.
*   **Bench Press:** Bouncing the bar off the chest, lifting the buttocks off the bench, flaring the elbows out at 90 degrees.
*   **Deadlift:** Rounding the upper or lower back, letting the bar drift away from the body.
*   **Overhead Press:** Excessively arching the lower back to complete the rep.
*   **Biceps Curl:** Using torso momentum to swing the weight up (cheating).

#### **» What recommendations should a personal trainer make to correct these common errors?**

*   Provide specific verbal and visual cues (e.g., "knees out," "chest up," "bar close to your shins").
*   Reduce the weight to a load that allows for proper form.
*   Use drills to reinforce proper motor patterns (e.g., face-the-wall squats).
*   Use video feedback to show the client the error.
*   Prescribe assistance exercises to strengthen weak muscle groups contributing to the error.

#### **» Identify possible modifications (regressions and progressions) for the primary free-weight exercises.**

*   **Regression (Easier):** Decrease weight. Use dumbbells instead of a barbell (allows for a more natural movement path). Use a safety rack (squat, bench) to allow bailing safely. Perform partial ROM.
*   **Progression (Harder):** Increase weight. Change the variation (e.g., from back squat to front squat). Increase tempo (e.g., explosive concentric). Add chains or bands for accommodating/variable resistance. Incorporate instability (e.g., performing exercises on one leg).

#### **» Identify the joint actions and associated muscles for each of the most common free weight resistance training exercises.**
*(This is detailed extensively in Table 4.2 and the exercise descriptions in Chapter 13. For example, the Bench Press involves shoulder horizontal adduction and elbow extension, primarily training the pectoralis major, anterior deltoid, and triceps brachii.)*

#### **» How does body position affect the force that a client can produce when performing a free-weight exercise?**

Body position dramatically affects force production through changes in **mechanical advantage (lever arms)**.
*   **Example 1 (Bicep Curl):** The resistance torque is greatest when the forearm is parallel to the floor (longest moment arm) and is zero when the weight is directly above or below the elbow (moment arm = 0).
*   **Example 2 (Squat):** A more upright torso position places greater demand on the knee extensors (quadriceps). A more forward-leaning torso shifts demand to the hip extensors (glutes, hamstrings) and plantar flexors.
*   **Example 3 (Bench Press):** An incline bench press shifts emphasis from the sternal portion of the pectoralis major to the clavicular portion and anterior deltoid.

### **F. Cardiovascular Machines (e.g., treadmill, stationary bike, rowing machine, stepping and climbing machine, elliptical trainer, upper body ergometer)**

» **How can the personal trainer ensure safe participation in cardiovascular activities?**  
Personal trainers can ensure safety by:
- Selecting appropriate footwear and clothing for the activity and environment.
- Providing clear instructions on how to use each machine properly.
- Monitoring clients for signs of fatigue or discomfort.
- Encouraging proper posture and joint alignment.
- Gradually progressing intensity and duration based on the client’s fitness level.

» **How can body position and joint alignment affect performance when using cardiovascular machines? What are the risks if these are not correct?**  
Proper body position and joint alignment improve efficiency and reduce injury risk. For example:
- On a treadmill, leaning too far forward or backward can strain the back.
- On a stair climber or elliptical, improper knee alignment (e.g., knee moving past toes) can increase stress on the knee joint.
- On a stationary bike, incorrect seat height can lead to knee or hip pain.

» **What are the appropriate recommendations when setting a client up to use a machine (e.g., treadmill, bicycle, rowing machine, stair stepper, elliptical trainer)?**  
- **Treadmill:** Start at a slow speed (e.g., 1 mph), encourage minimal handrail use, and ensure the client stays centered on the belt.
- **Bicycle:** Adjust seat height so the knee has a 25–30° bend at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Handlebar height should allow a comfortable forward lean.
- **Rowing machine:** Teach the proper sequence: drive with legs, lean back slightly, then pull with arms.
- **Stair stepper:** Avoid excessive hip sway; step depth should be 4–8 inches.
- **Elliptical trainer:** Maintain an upright posture; knees should not pass the toes.

» **How is proper seat height and location determined for use of a stationary bike?**  
Seat height should allow a slight bend (25–30°) in the knee when the foot is at the bottom of the pedal stroke. The knee should not be fully extended. Handlebar position should allow a relaxed forward lean without rounding the back.

» **Describe the generally accepted movement patterns of the exercise (e.g., joint range of motion, spinal alignment, foot strike, cadence).**  
- **Treadmill:** Heel-to-toe rolling action; upright spine; natural arm swing.
- **Bike:** Smooth circular pedaling; cadence of 60–100 rpm.
- **Rower:** Sequential movement: legs → torso → arms on the drive; reverse on recovery.
- **Stair stepper:** Full foot contact; controlled step depth; avoid knee hyperextension.
- **Elliptical:** Fluid motion; upright posture; avoid excessive lean.

» **What are recommended guidelines for breathing while exercising on a cardiovascular machine?**  
Breathe rhythmically and deeply. Avoid breath-holding. Inhale during less strenuous phases and exhale during exertion (e.g., exhale during the drive phase on a rower).

---

### **G. Non-machine Cardiovascular Activities (e.g., running, walking, swimming, aerobic dancing)**

» **What is the normal gait pattern for walking? Running?**  
- **Walking:** Heel strike, followed by rolling onto the ball of the foot and push-off. One foot always maintains contact with the ground.
- **Running:** Similar heel-to-toe roll, but with a flight phase where both feet are off the ground.

» **Describe common errors made by clients when performing alternative training activities.**  
- Rounding the back (e.g., during kettlebell swings)
- Using too much weight compromising form
- Poor grip or footing
- Incomplete range of motion

» **What recommendations should a personal trainer make to correct these common errors?**  
- Reduce load or resistance.
- Demonstrate and cue proper form.
- Use regression exercises (e.g., lighter implement).
- Provide tactile or verbal feedback.

» **Identify possible modifications (regressions and progressions) when using alternative training activities.**  
- **Regression:** Lighter weight, shorter range of motion, slower tempo.
- **Progression:** Heavier load, increased complexity, unstable surface, faster tempo.
