## 2 OLDER ADULTS  

### 2.1 Key Concepts & Exam Focus  

- **Definition**: Older adults (typically **age 65+**) experience age-related physiological declines but can improve function through exercise.  
- **Sarcopenia**: Age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, which can be mitigated through resistance training.  
  - Older adults who do not resistance train experience a **5% to 10%** reduction in muscle mass every decade 
  - older adults who do not resistance train also experience a **10% to 30%** reduction in bone mineral density every decade
  - average resting metabolic rate reduction of **3%** per decade
  - muscle strength is decreasing at the rate of **10% to 20%** and power is decreasing at the rate of **30% to 40%** per decade. 
- **Functional Independence**: Exercise programs should target **activities of daily living** (ADLs) to maintain independence.  
- **Health Considerations**: Higher prevalence of chronic conditions (e.g., arthritis, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease) requires careful screening and program modifications .  

### 2.2 Critical Statistics & Specifics  

- **Muscle Mass Increase**: Older adults can gain approximately **3 lb (1.4 kg)** of muscle mass over a few months of resistance training .  
- **Resistance Training**:  
  - **Repetition Range**: Begin with **10-15 repetitions** per set to allow for technique mastery and minimize joint stress .  
  - **Frequency**: **2-3 days/week** on non-consecutive days.  
  - **Intensity**: Moderate intensity (e.g., **5-6 on a 10-point RPE scale**).  
- **Balance Training**: Reduce fall risk with **3+ days/week** of balance activities (e.g., single-leg stands, tai chi).  
- **Bone Health**: Weight-bearing exercises help maintain bone density; osteoporosis management may require impact modifications.  

*Table: Resistance Training Components for Older Adults*
