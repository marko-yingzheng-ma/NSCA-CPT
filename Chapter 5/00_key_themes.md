### Key Themes of the Chapter  
1. **Resistance training is a substantial stressor** triggering musculoskeletal, endocrine, immune, and cardiorespiratory adaptations.  
   - Stress responses are **positive** (e.g., muscle growth, bone density, strength) and prepare the body for future stressors.  
   - *Incorrect claim*: Stress responses are "negative" (Study Q1: **B is incorrect**).  

2. **Progressive overload** (via volume, intensity, frequency) is critical but must avoid overaggressive programming (watch for soreness, pain, or plateaus).  
3. **Adaptations occur in phases**:  
   - Strength gains (1st month) → Hypertrophy (1–2 months) → Bone density (months to years).  
4. **Individual variability** in responses due to age, sex, genetics, and environment (e.g., **10–20% are "low responders"** for hypertrophy but still gain strength via neural adaptations).
