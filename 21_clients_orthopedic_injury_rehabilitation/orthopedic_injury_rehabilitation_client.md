## 1 Injury Classification

![alt text](img/common_muscle_injury.png)

### Key Concepts & Exam Focus
- **Macrotrauma**: Injury resulting from a **specific, sudden event** that causes structural damage (e.g., fractures, dislocations, ligament sprains, muscle tears). Characterized by **immediate pain and dysfunction**.
- **Microtrauma**: Injury resulting from **repeated, submaximal overload** to tissues over time, leading to **cumulative damage** . Often referred to as **"overuse injuries"** but can occur without physical activity (e.g., metabolic disorders, inflammatory conditions). Key features:
  - Results from **accumulation of tissue damage** across time
  - **Not always caused by repeated physical activity** (systemic factors can contribute)
  - Typically presents with **gradual onset of symptoms** that worsen progressively

### Critical Statistics & Specifics
- **Microtrauma injuries** account for approximately **30-50%** of all sports injuries according to epidemiological studies.
- **Stress fractures** occur most commonly in the **tibia (25-50%)**, metatarsals (10-25%), and fibula (7-15%) based on clinical studies.

### Study Question Integration
- **Question 1**: Which applies to microtrauma? 
  - **Answer**: D. II, III, and IV only (results from accumulation of tissue damage across time, often referred to as an overuse injury, not always caused by repeated physical activity).


## 2 Impact of Injury on Function

### Key Concepts & Exam Focus
- **Immediate effects**: **Pain, swelling, weakness**, and **reduced range of motion**.
- **Neuromuscular inhibition**: **Arthrogenic muscle inhibition** (AMI) refers to reflexive inhibition of muscles surrounding a joint after injury, leading to **weakness and atrophy**.
- **Movement compensation**: Development of **altered movement patterns** to avoid pain, which may persist after healing and increase risk of re-injury.

### Technique & Safety Precautions
- **Compensations to observe**: **Antalgic gait** (limping), **shoulder hiking** during arm elevation, **reduced weight-bearing** on injured side, **trunk leaning** during squatting.
- **Assessment tools**: **Movement Compensation Patterns** (MCPs) should be assessed using functional movement screens like the **Overhead Squat Assessment**, **Single-Leg Squat Assessment**, and **Push-Up Assessment**.

## 3 Tissue Healing After Injury

![alt text](img/q_a.png)


**Question 1**
Correct Answer: D. II, III, and IV only
Textbook Reference:
"Microtrauma... results from the accumulation of tissue damage across time... often referred to as an overuse injury... [It] is not always caused by repeated physical activity and can be the result of metabolic, neurologic, or other systemic conditions."
(Chapter 21, "Injury Classification")

Incorrect Options:
*   A. I only: This describes macrotrauma, which is a sudden and obvious episode of tissue overload, not microtrauma.
*   B. I and III only: Option I is incorrect as it describes macrotrauma. While III is correct, pairing it with I makes the entire choice wrong.
*   C. II and IV only: While II and IV are correct, option III is also a correct definition of microtrauma and should not be excluded.

**Question 2**
Correct Answer: D. repair and remodeling phases only
Textbook Reference:
"During the repair phase, controlled motion in the form of range-of-motion (ROM) exercises is advised... The remodeling phase... involves more aggressive active and passive ROM and stretching exercises."
(Chapter 21, "Tissue Healing After Injury")

Incorrect Options:
*   A. inflammation, repair, and remodeling phases: During the inflammation phase, the primary goals are protection and rest. ROM exercises are contraindicated as they can disrupt the initial healing process and increase swelling.
*   B. remodeling phase only: While ROM is critical in remodeling, it is also advised during the preceding repair phase to prevent contractures and guide collagen alignment.
*   C. repair phase only: ROM is advised in the repair phase, but it must also continue into the remodeling phase to be fully effective.

**Question 3**
Correct Answer: C. levator scapulae
Textbook Reference:
"Dysfunction of the rotator cuff, serratus anterior, and trapezius muscles has been associated with subacromial impingement." The levator scapulae is an elevator of the scapula; its weakness is not a primary contributor to impingement. Overactivity and tightness can contribute to poor posture, but weakness does not directly cause the impingement mechanism.
(Chapter 21, "Shoulder")

Incorrect Options:
*   A. upper and lower trapezius: Weakness in these muscles contributes to scapular dyskinesis (abnormal movement), which reduces the subacromial space and can lead to impingement.
*   B. serratus anterior: Weakness of the serratus anterior prevents upward rotation and posterior tilting of the scapula during arm elevation, which is a primary factor in reducing the subacromial space and causing impingement.
*   D. anterior deltoid: While not the most common cause, excessive tension or overdominance of the anterior deltoid without rotator cuff stabilization can contribute to superior translation of the humeral head, narrowing the subacromial space.

**Question 4**
Correct Answer: A. full squat
Textbook Reference:
"Contraindications... include deep squats (past 60°-90° of knee flexion)... because of the large amount of stress placed on the prosthetic components and the surrounding bone."
(Chapter 21, "Knee")

Incorrect Options:
*   B. leg extension: While heavy, open-chain leg extensions may be cautioned early on, they are not universally contraindicated. They are often used in rehabilitation to isolate the quadriceps, though often through a limited range of motion initially.
*   C. leg curl: This exercise is a standard part of post-arthroplasty rehabilitation to strengthen the hamstrings and provide stability to the knee joint.
*   D. cycling: Stationary cycling is a highly recommended activity after knee arthroplasty as it helps restore range of motion, is low-impact, and provides cardiovascular benefits.

**Question 5**
Correct Answer: C. isometric
Textbook Reference:
"During periods of exacerbation, the focus should be on pain reduction and preservation of function. Isometric exercise can be used to maintain muscle strength without moving the affected joints."
(Chapter 21, "Arthritis")

Incorrect Options:
*   A. concentric: Dynamic exercises, including concentric contractions, involve joint movement and are typically avoided during acute inflammatory periods (exacerbations) to prevent increased pain and joint stress.
*   B. eccentric: Like concentric contractions, eccentric contractions involve joint movement and high muscle forces, which can aggravate inflamed and painful joints during an exacerbation.
*   D. plyometric: Plyometrics are high-impact, high-stress exercises that are completely inappropriate during an exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis and are often contraindicated entirely for this population.
